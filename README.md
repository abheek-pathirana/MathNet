# MathNet
MathNet is the smallest known tool-calling SLM, combining algebraic (5.63M), arithmetic (5.27M), and gating (3.32M) models for under 14M parameters. Pretrained on handpicked Project Gutenberg texts and 100% synthetic task datasets (6.3M tokens each for algebraic/arithmetic, 6M for gating) for strong math reasoning.
